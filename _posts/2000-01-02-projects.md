### Research & Development Projects

- **[HUVis](https://huvis.github.io/)** Hybrid Urban Visualization
A survey of basic questions about spatial planning led to the research project Hybrid Urban Visualization (HUVis), which was co-financed by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI). The functional requirements were defined in an interdisciplinary team composed of architects, spatial planners, 3D visualization specialists and web front end developers. On the one hand, professionals should be able to generate static visualizations of future buildings from different perspectives in a simple way. On the other hand, planned buildings are to be made experienceable for the ordinary citizen. 

- **[European Music Portfolio](http://maths.emportfolio.eu/)** - Maths (EMP-M): Sounding Ways into Mathematics
It develops innovative and creative approaches to make the learning of mathematics (and music) more interesting, inquiry-based and engaging. This approach can have particular benefits for low achievers and students at risk. The project aims to enhance the quality and European dimension of in-service and initial teacher training courses by introducing a tested training curriculum dealing with interdisciplinary approaches to the teaching and learning of both mathematics and music.

- **[Entwicklung und Erarbeitung von Informatik-Inhalten](http://informatik-biber.ch/lehrmittel/)**
Within the scope of this development project, learning material for computer science is being developed. With the help of interactive and intuitive learning material young people can understand some central concepts of computer science.A modular content design allows the teachers to use the learning material flexibly and for different levels.

### Past Research Projects

- **[LiLa - Library of Labs](http://www.lila-project.org/)** LiLa is an acronym for ‚Library of Labs‘ , an initiative of eight universities and three companies, which aims at developing an integrated platform for remote experiments and virtual laboratories. LiLa was co-funded by the e**Content***plus* programme of the European Commission.

- **[lifeClipper 2](http://www.lifeclipper.net/)** The development of Augmented Reality (AR) scenarios for tourism and project visualisations were the objectives of lifeClipper 2. 
The project invited to a virtual extended walk in the area of the novartis campus in Basel. 
A set of sensors was designed for tracking the accurate position and the precise direction of view. The hybrid tracking system consisted of a GPS receiver, 3-D acceleration sensor and 3-D compass. 

- **[Nano-World](http://nano-world2.cs.unibas.ch)** - A Virtual Nanoscience Laboratory
Nano-World is a virtual laboratory for nano science experiments.
The multidisciplinary field of nanoscience draws on chemistry, physics and biology to investigate phenomena at the atomic and molecular level. As in a flight simulator, students find out how to handle new methods and instruments. They learn how atoms can be made visible, deduce physical properties from the tests and become familiar with the measuring processes.
